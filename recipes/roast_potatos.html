    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>1kg Maris Piper potatoes</li>
            <li>100g duck or goose fat (for a luxurious taste), or 100ml/3½fl oz olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp flour</li>
            <li>sea salt flakes, to serve</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Put a roasting tin in the oven (one big enough to take the potatoes in a single layer) and heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.
            </li> 
            <li>
               Peel 1kg potatoes and cut each into 4 even-sized pieces if they are medium size, 2-3 if smaller (5cm pieces).
           </li>
           <li>
            Drop the potatoes into a large pan and pour in enough water to barely cover them.
           </li>
           <li>
            Add salt, then wait for the water to boil. As soon as the water reaches a full rolling boil, lower the heat, put your timer on and simmer the potatoes uncovered, reasonably vigorously, for 2 mins.
           </li>
           <li>
            Meanwhile, put 100g duck or goose fat or 100ml olive oil into the hot roasting tin and heat it in the oven for a few minutes, so it’s really hot.
           </li>
           <li>
            Drain the potatoes in a colander, then shake the colander back and forth a few times to fluff up the outsides.
           </li>
           <li>
            Sprinkle with 2 tsp flour and give another shake or two so they are evenly and thinly coated.
           </li>
           <li>
            Carefully put the potatoes into the hot fat – they will sizzle as they go in – then turn and roll them around so they are coated all over.
           </li>
           <li>
            Spread them in a single layer making sure they have plenty of room.
           </li>
           <li>
            Roast the potatoes for 15 mins, then take them out of the oven and turn them over.
           </li>
           <li>
            Roast for another 15 mins and turn them over again. Put them back in the oven for another 10-20 mins, or however long it takes to get them really golden and crisp. The colouring will be uneven, which is what you want.
           </li>
           <li>
            Scatter with the sea salt flakes and serve straightaway.
           </li>
        </ol>
